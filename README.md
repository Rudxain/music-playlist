This is a temporary repo. It'll be deleted when no more tracks are left to move.

main.txt is the list that I'll gradually sync with my [SC](https://soundcloud.com/rudxain/sets/music-playlist) & [YT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUryK3zza2ScWOhbd__X4Ne0xC6TlKiiH) playlists.

main.csv is from a family member. I auto-generated the CSV from a filesystem directory, by using a Python script with [EyeD3](https://eyed3.readthedocs.io/en/latest) as a dependency.

Not all tracks will survive, I still need to review them, to check if I like them (there are some tracks I've never heard)

The "ES" files are screenshots taken in "ES File Explorer".
The working-directory is Geometry Dash's (for Android) [Newgrounds audio](https://newgrounds.com/audio) folder (yes, the device was rooted). That's why the filenames are NG Audio IDs.

## CONTRIBUTING

If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

Please keep the list sorted! Use "Binary Search Insertion" for efficiency.

main.csv must be reformatted and merged with main.txt .

I want to transcribe [/tmp/](tmp) to main.txt, please help me.

BTW, if you know who did the "Ookay - Thief" remix, I will really appreciate it!
I have the feeling that audio will be the last file to survive in this repo, because it's so hard to find the author.
