This is a temporary repo. It'll be deleted when no more tracks are left to move.

Not all tracks will survive, I still need to review them, to check if I like them (there are some tracks I've never heard)

## dir tree

- `main.txt` is the list that I'll gradually sync with my [SC](https://soundcloud.com/rudxain/sets/music-playlist) & [YT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUryK3zza2ScWOhbd__X4Ne0xC6TlKiiH) playlists.
- `main.tsv` is from a family member. I auto-generated it from a filesystem directory, by using a Python script with [EyeD3](https://eyed3.readthedocs.io/en/latest) as a dependency.
- `manager.py` is an unfinished script that closes [#2](https://github.com/Rudxain/music-playlist/issues/2)
- `/tmp/` is [explained here](tmp/README.md)

## CONTRIBUTING

If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

Please keep the list sorted! Use "Binary Search Insertion" for efficiency.

DO NOT add stuff to `main.tsv`. I want to reformat it, then merge with `main.txt`.

I want to transcribe `/tmp/*` to `main.txt`.

BTW, if you know who did the "Ookay - Thief" remix, I will really appreciate it!
I have the feeling that audio will be the last file to survive in this repo, because it's so hard to find the author.
