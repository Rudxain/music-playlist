main.txt is the list that I'll gradually sync with my [SC](https://soundcloud.com/rudxain/sets/music-playlist) & [YT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUryK3zza2ScWOhbd__X4Ne0xC6TlKiiH) playlists.

This is a temporary repo. It'll be deleted when no more tracks are left to move.

Not all tracks will survive, I still need to review them, to check if I like them (there are some tracks I've never heard)

If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

I'm manually (with some G Lens) transcribing **lots** of screenshots into this list, that's why the growth rate will be initially positive
